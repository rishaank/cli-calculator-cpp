## Installation

Installation is simple. 

### Windows installation

1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/rishaank/cli-calculator-cpp/releases) and download the installer .exe and follow the steps on your screen.

2.  Note that Windows or your browser might detect this as an "unsafe file" but this file is completely safe. You can just ignore these messages. Windows detects it as an unsafe file because it has an "unknown publisher".

   ### MacOS installation

   1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/rishaank/cli-calculator-cpp/releasesinstall) and download the .zip file which has 'Mac' in its name.
   2.  To run it you have to extract the zip file (preferably by Archive utility) and run the file inside. 
   3. There will be another folder which says: Calculator Contents, which you do not need to run it. If you are on another PC platform (this program is designed for computers),  you need to download the .cpp file and manually compile it. 

### Uninstalling

### Windows

To uninstall on Windows you can use the uninstaller to uninstall the app like any other app. Uninstalling instructions are below.

1. Open control panel by searching for it in search and opening it.
2. On the top click View by then select Category.
3. Click Uninstall a program on the bottom left corner of the window.
4. Find CLI-Calculator and click uninstall on the top.
5. Confirm that you want to uninstall and the program will be uninstalled.

### Other Platforms (including MacOS) 

On any other platform, like MacOS, just delete all the files you installed, for example, on MacOS if I installed the zip file on my desktop and extracted it, to uninstall it I would delete the zip file and its extracted contents.

## Editing

To edit this file on any PC platform you need to have an application which can open .cpp files such as [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) (click the name to go to the installation webpage) (Dev-C++ is currently not compatible with MacOS so you can use other apps like [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12). I used Dev-C++ and Xcode when making this program.

The commands to use this calculator are below:
